Problem Statement
Ram has a military dog who has the special ability of hearing, He can hear frequencies starting from 70Hz to 44000Hz (both inclusive). Now Ram wants to detect some unusual sounds across him. Tell "Yes" or "No" whether his dog can detect the sound or not.
Input
First line of the input contains the value of Test cases T.
Each test case consists of a single integer X - the frequency of unusual sound in Hertz.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 104
1 ≤ X ≤ 105
Output
Print Yes or No wether his dog can detect them or not for each test case.
Example
Sample Input
