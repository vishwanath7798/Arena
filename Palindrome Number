Problem Statement
Given a number N, you need to check whether the given number is Palindrome or not. A number is said to be Palindrome when it reads the same from backward as forward.
Input
User task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about the input. You just have to complete the function isPalindrome() which contains N as a parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 9999
Output
You need to return "True" is the number is palindrome otherwise "False".
Example
Sample Input:
5

Sample Output:
True

Sample Input:
121

Sample Output:
True

static void isPalindrome(int N)
	{
	   int r, sum=0, temp;
	   temp=N;
	   while(temp!=0){
		   r=temp%10; //getting remainder
		   sum=(sum*10)+r;
		   temp=temp/10;
	   }
	   String p = N==sum ? "True":"False";
	   System.out.print(p);
	}
