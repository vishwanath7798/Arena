Problem Statement
Given three distinct numbers a, b and c which denotes the age of three person 1, 2, 3.
Output the youngest and oldest person among three.
Input
Three integers are given as input. a, b, and c denotes the age of person 1, 2, 3 respectively.

Constraints
1 ≤ a ≤ 105
1 ≤ b ≤ 105
1 ≤ c ≤ 105
Output
Print the youngest and the oldest person number respectivley.
Example
Sample Input:
12 11 7

Sample Output:
3 1

Explanation:
7 is the least among all three so 3 has the least age and similarly, 12 is the maximum among three so 1 is the oldest.
