Problem Statement
You are given an integer A and a floating point number B, upto exactly two decimal places. Compute their product, truncate its fractional part, and print the result as an integer.
Input
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function solve() that takes an integer and a float as arguments.

Constraints
0<=A<=2 x 1015
0<=Bi<=10
Output
Return the product after truncating the fractional part.
Example
Sample Input:
155
2.41

Sample Output:
373

The result is 373.55, after truncating the fractional part, we get 373.

class Solution {
    long solve(long a, double b) {
        b= (b*100);

        return (a*(long)b)/100;
    }
}
