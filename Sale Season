Problem Statement
It's the sale season and Ankit bought items worth a total of X rupees. The sale season offer is as follows:
if X ≤ 100, no discount.
if 100 < X ≤ 1000, discount is 25 rupees.
if 1000 < X ≤ 5000, discount is 100 rupees.
if X > 5000, discount is 500 rupees.
Find the final amount Ankit needs to pay for his shopping.
Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of single line of input containing an integer X.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X ≤ 10000
Output
For each test case, output on a new line the final amount Ankit needs to pay for his shopping.
Example
Sample Input :
4
15
70
250
1000
Sample Output :
15
70
225
975
Explanation :
Since X ≤ 100, there is no discount.
Here, X = 250. Since 100 < 250 ≤ 1000, discount is of 25 rupees. Therefore, Ankit needs to pay 250 − 25 = 225 rupees.
