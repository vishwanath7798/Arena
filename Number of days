Example
Sample Input 1:-
1

Sample Output 1:
31

Sample Input 2:-
2

Sample Output 2:-
28

static void numberofdays(int M){
//Enter your code here
switch (M){
    case 1: System.out.print(31);
            break;
    case 2: System.out.print(28);
            break;
    case 3: System.out.print(31);
            break;
    case 4: System.out.print(30);
            break;
    case 5: System.out.print(31);
            break;
    case 6: System.out.print(30);
            break;
    case 7: System.out.print(31);
            break;
    case 8: System.out.print(31);
            break;
    case 9: System.out.print(30);
            break;
    case 10: System.out.print(31);
            break;
    case 11: System.out.print(30);
            break;
    case 12: System.out.print(31);
            break;
    }
