Problem Statement
Write a program to print the pattern of "*" in the form of the Right Angle Triangle.
See the below example for clarity.
Input

In the custom input area, you can provide any positive integer and check whether your code is working or not.
Output
Print the right angle triangle of height 5 as shown.
