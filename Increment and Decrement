Problem Statement
You must be familiar with various types of operators. One of the most commonly used operators in other languages is increment and decrement operators. Given two numbers X and Y. Your task is to print the value of X decremented by 1 and value of Y after incremented by 1.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers X and Y.

Constraints:
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10000
Output
You need to perform the task as mentioned in the question, and finally, print the result separated by a space.
Example
Sample Input 1:
4 5

Sample Output 1:
3 6

Sample Input 2:
5 6

Sample Output 2:
4 7


import java.io.*; // for handling input/output
import java.util.*; // contains Collections framework

// don't change the name of this class
// you can add inner classes if needed
class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        // Your code here
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int x=sc.nextInt();
        x=--x;
        int y=sc.nextInt();
        y=++y;
        System.out.print(x+" "+y);
    }
}
